# SXMPLEPortfolio
Portfolio site for SXMPLE Studios, an indie game development studio

#Features
This is not an ordinary portfolio site, this site is actually a CRUD site. 
The site was made with maintenance in mind, an admin portal exists for admins at SXMPLE to add, update, and remove members and projects.
